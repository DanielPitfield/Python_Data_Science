# Video Game Sales (Data Anlaysis)

Data analysis of a dataset with sales information of over 16,500 games that have sold more than 100,000 copies (dataset sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales/data).

An interactive web page (achieved using the nbinteract Python package) is hosted in the form of a GitHub Projects page for this project (https://danielpitfield.github.io/Python_Data_Science).

The 'Show Widgets' button (found at the top of the page) will load widgets after certain code bocks to allow for interactive input to dynamically change the output (graphs, tables etc.) of the analysis.
